# AnnoyingEx by Thomas That

## Extra Credit
I have completed these extra credits:

1. In requirement 3.a.v.2., when a user launches the MainActivity from the notification, it should display the text that was in the message/notification somewhere in the activity.
2. Create another separate worker that runs every 2 days that fetches JSON only when the deviceâ€™s battery is not too low and is connected to a network.
